# Project Name

## Overview

This project is a Python-based application. To get started, you'll need to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies before running the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- **Python 3.6+**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip3**: This is the package installer for Python, typically included with Python. Check if pip is installed by running:

  ```bash
  pip3 --version
  ```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: In your project directory, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Once the virtual environment is created, activate it:

   - **On Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Project**: After installing all dependencies, you can start the project by running:

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to activate the virtual environment each time you work on this project.
- If you encounter issues, check that all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed correctly.
